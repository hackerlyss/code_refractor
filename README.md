This first homework assignment's goal is to build an accessible landing page using semantic CSS and HTML.
I have primarily used Chrome to check out my website, but the code looks just as nice on Microsoft Edge.
I took the liberty of adding a reset CSS sheet to calibrate the browser for my stylized CSS sheet.
I left the contact box as it was except for making it's appearance a bit flashier.
I decided to add in my own preferred image, but had to make sure it was not too large of a file. This image also as a caption.
I also went with a color scheme of warm hues and a bright accent color to make the site pop.
I figured out how to include emojis so I inserted a rocket to emphasize the fact that we have landed on this page.
I customized the navbar links with pseudo classes to visualize when a link has already been visited.
